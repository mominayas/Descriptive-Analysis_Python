# Descriptive Analysis of Demographic Data

This repository contains the project work for the **Descriptive Analysis of Demographic Data**.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes data from the International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau. The dataset (`census2004_2024.csv`) includes life expectancy at birth and under-age-5 mortality rates for 227 countries across two years (2004 and 2024), stratified by sex and divided into geographical regions and subregions.

This project aims to apply descriptive and explorative statistical methods to understand and analyze demographic data trends.

### Dataset Details

- **Variables**:
  - Life Expectancy at Birth
  - Under Age 5 Mortality Rates
- **Regions**: Divided into 5 regions and 21 subregions.
- **Years**: 2004 and 2024.
- **Stratification**: By sex (male and female).

**Source**: [International Data Base](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/international-programs/about/idb.html) by the U.S. Census Bureau.

## Tasks Performed

### 1. Frequency Distributions
- Analyzed the distribution of life expectancy and mortality rates in 2024.
- Compared differences between sexes and geographical regions.
- Visualized data using histograms and density plots.

### 2. Variability and Central Tendency
- Investigated variability within subregions and compared it between subregions for one chosen region.
- Used measures such as standard deviation and mean to highlight intra- and inter-region homogeneity/heterogeneity.

### 3. Bivariate Correlations
- Computed correlations between life expectancy and mortality rates in 2024.
- Explored relationships using scatter plots and correlation coefficients.

### 4. Temporal Changes
- Compared changes in life expectancy and mortality rates between 2004 and 2024.
- Highlighted trends and discussed potential reasons for observed changes.
